Linear Regression on Diabetes Dataset (Regression)

This code analyzes the diabetes dataset using Linear Regression for predicting disease progression.
It begins by loading the dataset and converting it into a pandas data frame to facilitate exploration. 
Basic statistics and visualizations such as histograms and a correlation heatmap are generated to understand feature distributions and relationships. 
After splitting the data into training and testing sets, a Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated based on its Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set, providing insights into its predictive performance for diabetes progression.
